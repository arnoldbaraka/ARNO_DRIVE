# 🏎️ ARNO DRIVE

**ARNO (Autonomous Racing Network Operations — DRIVE)** is a futuristic, Nairobi-based car racing match platform where drivers connect, compete, and climb the leaderboard — all from their own registered rides. The platform leverages real-world maps (like Nairobi Bypass highways) and futuristic tech concepts for weekly bi-race matchmaking.
